= BUILDING A PROFESSIONAL SELF-SERVICE SUPPORT CENTER =

**Customer support** is a high-priority ongoing operation task for any successful business that would like to build a great market reputation.  When a business is starting to scale up it is vital to provide easy access to the product's "how to" information in a centralized self-service center. Otherwise, every question will be translated into a support ticket, flooding the support team, and increasing the business operational costs. 

**IncredibleDocs** provides a complete knowledge base management solution to create, monitor, and optimize content for your self-service support center. You can create a variety of types of content (e.g. documents, links, FAQs), organize content items into hierarchical categories, add tags, and fully customize the front-end views of any provided component. 

= UNIFED CONTENT MANAGEMENT PLATFORM = 

IncredibleDocs revolutionize the way you build, manage, and optimize content for knowledge bases. All content types are managed under a unified admin page with advanced filtering options. The content is divided into multiple content types (documents, links, FAQs) with a dedicated configuration and advanced frontend views. Each content item is then assigned to a designated location.

= HIGHLY SCALABLE FOR FAST LOADING = 

IncredibleDocs is designed to scale up in all directions. You can create one or multiple knowledge bases, and in each knowledge base create multiple categories and FAQ groups. And then create multiple content items from multiple content types inside each category. The plugin uses a smart caching technique to reduce the load on the database and provides a much faster page load time.

= FULL FRONTEND DESIGN CUSTOMIZATION =

Each knowledge base instance has a unique customized design setting, meaning you can have different frontend views for different knowledge bases. There are several front-end views, and each view is divided into modules. Each module has a group of elements that can be fully customized using the WordPress customizer tool.

= AUTOMATED URLs =

Everything is fully automated. You don't need to use a single shortcode for visual content on your website. Each knowledge base, category, tag, FAQ group, and content item has a unique automated URL. The frontend view is uses your website theme header and footer and then displays the relevant modules based on the URL, required content, and design settings for that knowledge base. 

= LIVE CONTENT SEARCH =

A live search engine is used to help visitors easily search and discover the required content in a dedicated search bar module. The live search can be extended with the super search module as part of the pro version, adding filters, searching in tags, and dynamic video links. In addition, each search query is recorded in the database to be used for the main dashboard KPIs and the analytics view. 

= AUTOMATED TOC = 

When creating a document content item, you can use heading elements to divide the content. Those heading elements will be used by the frontend view to automatically create a table of contents for easy navigation inside the document view.

= DASHBOARD VIEW = 

A centralized dashboard is used to track and monitor performance KPIs (e.g. total visitors, search success rate, etc.) across all knowledge bases, review content summary statistics, and configuration per knowledge base instance.

= SEO-FRIENDLY = 

- Optimized page size - the plugin uses a smart technique to dynamically load the minimum required CSS and JS data for every frontend view or any shortcode being used. 
- Caching - the plugin utilize cached transients to reduce the load on your database and provide much faster page load time. 
- Dynamic schema is generated for key content information (e.g. list of FAQs) 
- Out-of-the-box icons for knowledge bases and categories are based on embedded SVG data without any file transfer. 
- Mobile friendly - all frontend views are using the bootstrap framework. 
- Internal content links - content items are internally linked to improve navigation. 
- Compatibility with leading SEO plugins. 
- HTML code is optimized for accessibility. 

= SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE =

IncredibleDocs is developed and maintained with a strong focus on security and full compliance with WordPress's requirements. To build secure and reliable solutions, we follow a development lifecycle based on industry best practices. Our code is manually and automatically checked for detecting potential vulnerabilities. 

= ðŸ”¥ IncredibleDocs Pro's features: ðŸ”¥ =

**Close the Feedback Loop** - a great knowledge base is established by incremental content updates. You can collect simple like/dislike ratings, 5-star rating, and detailed feedback from visitors. This information will be used to track overall performance, pinpoint quality issues and discover more opportunities to better help your customers.

**Design Tools** - export, import, or rest all design settings for each knowledgebase instance.
